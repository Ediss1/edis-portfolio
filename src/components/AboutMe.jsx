      <p>
        Iâ€™m a second-year student at the International Business-Information Academy in Tuzla. My major is Computer Science. 
        Until now, I have put a lot of effort into almost every part of IT, and I am still craving knowledge. Now, more than 
        ever, I want to leave a mark. I am a very pleasant and friendly person, and I love working in groups. My main focus 
        is on programming and solving new problems because I find it the most interesting.
      </p>
